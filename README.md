# bikesharing

## Overview

This project is about using real data from Citibike in New York City to help convince a fake company in Des Moines to start a bike sharing business. Using data visualization tools, we can show how the business would be successful if it were to open. The tool in this case is Tableau, and can be found at the link below:

## Results

The first piece of data we look at is how long the average checkout time is:

We see that the majority of rides fall between the one and ten minute mark, making the turnaround for new customers very quick. This will help ensure that demand is readily met even with a limited supply of bikes.

If the company decides to not have a lot of bikes because of this fact, we should look at when the best times to service the bikes are. That way we can make sure a limited supply keeps up with demand:

From this, we see the best window to do this is between 2am-4am.

We then look at checkout time by gender to see what kinds of people are using the bikes:

This shows the customers are predominantely male, so we want our bikes in areas where there's a higher concentration of men being able to ride them.

In addition to gender, we want to see the age range of people using our bikes. We see that below:

What we see here is predominantely younger people renting bikes, so we also want to gear towards having the bikes in a location where more young people can see them vs old people.

Now that we have all who is using our bikes and know when they're being used, we should see some more detail on usage pattern. Here is how things breakdown by the days of the week, and specific hours of each day:

It seems like the highest use periods are specifically 6am-9am, and 4pm-7pm on weekdays with solid use between 10am-7pm on weekends. This is likely because people are renting bikes to head to work as a lower cost method of travel. 

Breaking things further down by gender, we see the following over these three images:

Like previously, we see the majority of our users are male. This goes to further our guess that people are using this to go to work. In order to back that up, let's take one final look at how many trips are being taken by each gender every day of the week:

This shows heavy usage during weekdays by men who have signed up to use the bikes regularly. That backs up our belief that the primary target audience is young men who ride these bikes to work.

## Summary

Overall, the data suggests that if there are lot of young men that can pay who are looking for alternate forms of transportation to work, opening up a bike sharing company in Des Moines is a good idea. The data backs this up as it consistently shows male users with peak usage during work hours. This business plan however hindges on two things that are outside of the citibike data. The first is how many men are in Des Moines? The second is what is the average age of men in Des Moines? We would need to take a look at census data to find out the answer to both of those questions.
