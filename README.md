# bikesharing

## Overview

This project is about using real data from Citibike in New York City to help convince a fake company in Des Moines to start a bike sharing business. Using data visualization tools, we can show how the business would be successful if it were to open. The tool in this case is Tableau, and can be found at the link below:
